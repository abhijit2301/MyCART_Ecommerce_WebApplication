# MyCART_Ecommerce_WebApplication
Technologies used: I built this web application using Java, along with some other tools like JDBC and Hibernate for managing the database, Servlets for handling requests, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating the web interface. MySQL is the database system I used to store information.

Modules Implemented:

Admin Login: There's a special login for administrators. Only they can access it. It's like a secure entrance for the people managing the website.
User Login: Regular users have their own login too. They can use it to buy products from the website.
Functionalities:

Admin Access: The admin can add or delete products from the website. It's like they have special powers to manage what's available for users.
User Access: Regular users can browse the website and buy products they like.
So, in simple terms, it's a website where admins can manage products and regular users can buy them.
